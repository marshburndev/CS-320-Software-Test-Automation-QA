How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  
  Through utilization of up to date code practices, frequent testing and reviewing of the code, and adhering to design principles, one can ensure software is adequately designed and secure for use.  
  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  
  During the requirements phase, it is very important to capture the entire picture and gather all the necessary details to make sure the software is being designed to the users needs.  Following the initial gathering of requirements, it is important to utilize an iterative nature when testing and reviewing the software to further make sure current requirements are functioning as expected and to include additional requirements that may not have been initially requested.  
  
How do I approach designing software?
  
  A holistic and iterative approach.  First, one must try to capture all the requirements or purpose of the software so they may be able to map out the design correctly.  The software must then be constructed without bias and tested/reviewed frequently to ensure funtionality and that the software is being designed to the users needs.  As stated, an iterative apporach will also be used in development of the software as designing and implementing software usually benefits from multiple iterations and the first "rough draft" or "version" of the software will likely need to be modified or updated before completion.
